# Smurf-attack-Simulation
This script is created solely for educational purposes and should not be used for any commercial or malicious activities. I am not responsible for any damages that may occur as a result of running this script.
This program is meant to simulate how a simple smurf attack could happen. Within, you simply need to add the appropriate broadcast address and spoofed source address. The program will go through the list of broadcast addresses and send them a crafted ICMP and IP packet. These broadcast addresses will send the echo request to all the hosts within the network, which will create a large amount of traffic within the network. The host's devices will all send an echo reply packet, which will be sent to the spoofed source address. This will in turn overwhelm the device.
